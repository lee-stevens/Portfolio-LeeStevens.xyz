# Lee Stevens Portfolio - React

Hi there, my name is Lee Stevens and this is the repository for my React.js portfolio

This portfolio was my first project with using a library or framework and introduced me to the wonderous world of JavaScript's capabilities.

Since, developing this portfolio, I moved over to MEAN full-stack having developed the essential web dev skills needed, I frequently come back to React, but Angular is my focus.

You can find the latest deployment available at: (Leestevens.xyz)[https://leestevens.xyz/] as well as my current projects on my public Github project (LeesProjects | Project View)[https://github.com/users/leesprojects/projects/2/views/1]
