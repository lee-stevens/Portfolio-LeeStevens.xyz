# Lee Stevens Portfolio - React
Hello and welcome to the repository for my portfolio developed in react. I set myself a challenge to branch out into front-end web development, 
and there was no more suitable task than to create myself a portfolio!

It has been a very enjoyable and yet stressful endeavour as I have learned entirely from youtube and various forums, mainly StackOverflow. In addition to learning React, I have also
created another website using only ThreeJS which can be found <a href="https://leestevens-portfolio-three.netlify.app/">Here<a> or by it's 
<a href="https://github.com/leesprojects/Portfolio-Three">GitHub Repository<a>

You can find the latest deployment available at: https://leestevens-portfolio-react.netlify.app/ or leestevens.xyz
