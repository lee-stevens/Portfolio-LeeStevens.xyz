# Lee Stevens Portfolio - React

Publically available at [Leestevens.xyz](https://leestevens.xyz/)

Hi there, my name is Lee Stevens and this is the repository for my React.js portfolio

This portfolio was my first project with using a JavaScript library and marks the itself as my first complete web development project!

Since, developing this portfolio, I moved over to MEAN full-stack having developed the essential web dev skills needed, I frequently come back to React, but Angular is my focus.
