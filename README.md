# Lee Stevens Portfolio - React

This portfolio is available at [Leestevens.xyz](https://leestevens.xyz/), which alongside my [Github Readme](https://github.com/leesprojects), give an overview into my life and development as a web developer.

# About this repo

This website was my first experience with a front-end framework, and developed into becomming my permanent portfolio.

Since learning the basics of React and website basics, I've been able to understand the world of web development. 

It enabled me to first understand the use cases of front-end frameworks and also that there are so many components to web development such as CSS preprocessors (SCSS), Backends, Databases etc... 

Although I now primarily work in Angular, this one project will always remain in React, and perhaps recreated with a React-based framework like NextJS
